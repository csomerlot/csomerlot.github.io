* [First iteration](./PlantWaterer/PlantWaterer.html) of the design was a simple Trinket-based timer that controlled a [mini peristaltic pump](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1150). It worked if the water source was elevated to deal with the limits of the pump curve.


#### Logic:
1. Start flood event:
    1. turn on air pump and close air release valve for until level has stabilized to within 0.25" for 5 minutes
        1. Report solution level from both sensors every 15 seconds
    1. if it has been more than 20 minutes, terminate on cycle and alert
    1. if water detected in overflow tank, terminate on cycle and alert
    1. if sensors do not agree on level, alert
    1. if solution level falls below 3", alert
1. Alert:
    1. flash the built-in light
    1. play noise
    1. send text message

##  The Best Damn Radio System 

#### Description: 
Tiny HAM radio that can be used anywhere

#### User Story: 
The world is still a big place and to explore certain parts in safety, we need a way to broadcast an emergency. PLBS are really only domestic, not hackable (or even able to replace batteries), and for emergency only. Sat messengers have not-insignificant subscription fees, and varying coverage. HAM remains the most ubiquitous global radio infrastructure, and with help, can be transmitted from any global location, for a variety of needs.

#### Feature Set:
1. Handheld SDR
1. Use APRS+GPS for tracking mode?
1. Use FT8 for long-distance messaging?
1. Can be modded to suit the locale and needs of a trip
1. Has a base station/ repeater mode
1. Can be used for personal emergency messaging, way-point tacking, sharing progress
1. Ruggedize by potting in epoxy with heat sinks?
1. Cheap and small enough to carry spares
1. Yagi antenna to use as a directional beacon?

#### Notes: Reference devices:
* [Tiny tracker](https://www.byonics.com/tinytrak4)
* [Inreach Explorer](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/561269)
* [PortableSDR on Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/1538-portablesdr)
