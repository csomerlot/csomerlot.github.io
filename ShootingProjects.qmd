I have a Howa 1500 in 308 that I like a lot, would love a CVA Scout or Tikka T3x (or a Sako90 if I was rich) in 300 WinMag maybe.

##  F-class 1000+yarder 
1. Action: Bighorn TL3 (multi-caliber!)
1. Barrel
    1. rebarrel from Hart (includes the action work)
    1. 308 Winchester or 300 WinMag
    1. Long and heavy: 30" to develop max velocity?
    1. Contour to make barrel same diameter as muzzle brake, but keep heavy
1. Optics
    1. Osprey Global or Arken, 10-40x50 or so, I like mil dot illuminated
    1. anti-cant level
    1. Picatinny 20 MOA scope mount
1. Muzzle brake?
1. Make a custom laminate stock: mostly, for fun
    1. Build up from laser cut ply, laminate with epoxy and carve
    1. [Pachmayr Decelerator](https://www.lymanproducts.com/brands/pachmayr/recoil-pads) slip-on recoil pad on large butt plate
    1. Free float the barrel, use aluminum pillars, and glass bed the action
1. Timney trigger
1. Bipod

##  Inline Muzzleloader 
Best hunting option for range, lethality, legality, season? Thompson Center makes a good entry one. 50 caliber ballistics very [similar to .300BLK](https://www.snipercountry.com/300-blackout-vs-308/)

##  Handmade Recurve Bow 
1. Specs
