======= Common Sensor and Datalogger Platform =======
__Description:__
Portable and wireless environmental IoT sensor and datalogger

__User Story:__
We want to be able measure a variety of environmental conditions, without hooking up wiring. We can place a sensor indoors or outdoors just for 
spot checks or leave it for several weeks or add a solar power pack for permanent power. We can hook it up to a dashboard to monitor and 
provide alarms, or use it in more remote conditions and have it upload once wifi is available, or use a cell modem. Some possible applications include:
* Dive computer
* Bike computer
* Drone computer
* Weather Balloon computer
* Environmental Datalogger
* Marine Chartplotter
* Indoor air quality
* Energy Monitor
* Domotics, solar, or hydroponics controller

__Feature Set:__
* Internet connection discovery and automatic frequent communication
* Plenty of digital and analog inputs
* LCD Screen and a few buttons for basic status and config
* 2-week battery life

__Logic:__
- Controller:
    o Init last send time on startup
    o Read data
    o Save data to data file
    o If communications enabled:
        o If MQTT feed not present, establish one
        o Send data going back to last successful time
        o If send succeeds, save time
    o Log everything
    o Pause (vary time by event status or actively via MQTT)
    o loop back to step 2
- Host:
    o Check for duplicated data, save new
    o Check for alarm levels
    o Log everything

======= Wood Burning Plotter =======
__Description:__ 
A polar coordinate-based dual axis large-format plotter that uses solar power to maneuver a magnifying 
lens over a wooden canvas vertically to burn an image.

__User Story:__ 
Plotters are simple output devices, but can require a large amount of track and 
infrastructure; using 2 motors to control location of marker via line in/out in a polar coordinate 
fashion will allow the device to scale up to billboard size for a giant art display, say along a 
major north/south interstate highway. For example. 

__Feature Set:__
o Weatherproof and hidden controller, motor, and spindle housing
o Solar-powered
o Spool capacity of 50' of 30# braided fishing line
o Spooling speed control from 1mm/min - 25mm/min
o Optical sensor for darkness of burn
o Removable controller, for image and software update
o Calibration process
o Fire suppression

======= Fixed Wing UAV =======
__Description:__ 
open-source, open-hardware driven custom fixed-wing UAV platform for efficient 
mapping projects and long-distance linear asset inspection
 
__User Story:__
Quadcopter UAVs are great for inspections and tight places, but require many 
batteries and many flights to capture site imagery used for mapping. They are also expensive and difficult to control. With so many camera and sensor options available off-the-shelf, a fixed-wing platform like the eBee makes a lot of sense for certain types of missions.
 
__Feature Set:__
o 500 gram payload
o Assisted take-off
o Automated flights

!split
======= Motocomms =======
__Description:__
A simple and mostly off-the-shelf communication and audio system for helmets

__User Story:__
helmet comm units are stupid expensive and sound terrible. And are additive to road 
noise. And clumsy to control and link. And vendor specific. And another thing to keep charged. 
And dumb in concept: who's wants a 5 hr running conversation when we just need to communicate 
when stopped at an intersection about which way to turn? I want a way to use my noise-reducing 
earbuds with an off the shelf radio through my phone so that I can also hear music or GPS. 
Also, I like to keep my phone in my jacket pocket so there are no dangling wires. But I don't 
want to have to look at the radio to use it or worry about charging it before riding.

__Feature Set:__
o Custom FRS, GMRS, or CB integration
    o GMRS appears to offer best cost-vs-performance, with usable range of a couple miles and cross-compatibility with FRS
    o "Custom-built HAM radio?": "http://projects.somerlot.net/._RoboticsProjects016.html#___sec15"
o Integration with phone for multi-audio stream management
o Custom handlebar control to only activate mic during push-to-talk, or switch it to VOX for regular hands-free
o Charging bracket
o Cross-use capable for skiing, hiking, trekking, and emergencies that are out of cell range
o Components that are cheap enough to keep spares of or available enough to find anywhere

__Phasing:__
o Purchase radio unit
o Start with wired connectivity, with phone and radio in tank bag:
    o Build audio plug adapter to splice radio and phone to earbuds
    o Add handlebar switch to mic for PTT
o Add wireless integration
    o Build radio mount with charge bracket
    o Build custom Bluetooth audio adapter to connect radio to phone

======= The Best Damn Radio System =======

__Description:__ Tiny HAM radio that can be used anywhere

__User Story:__ The world is still a big place and to explore certain parts in safety, we need a way to broadcast an emergency. 
PLBS are really only domestic, not hackable (or even able to replace batteries), and for emergency only. Sat messengers have 
not-insignificant subscription fees, and varying coverage. HAM remains the most ubiquitous global radio infrastructure, and with 
help, can be transmitted from any global location, for a variety of needs.
 
__Feature Set:__
o Uses APRS for tracking mode
o Can be modded to suit the locale and needs of a trip
o Can be launched airborne via flare or rocket (and recovered) for visibility and reach
o Can be used for personal messaging, way-point tacking, sharing progress
o Provides a backup near-field communication device by integrating with a headset, antenna, and power source
o Ruggedized
o Cheap and small enough to carry spares

__Notes:__
* Ruggedize by potting in epoxy with heat sinks?
