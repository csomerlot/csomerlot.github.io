======= Motocomms =======
__Description:__
A simple and mostly off-the-shelf communication and audio system for helmets

__User Story:__
helmet comm units are stupid expensive and sound terrible. And are additive to road
noise. And clumsy to control and link. And vendor specific. And another thing to keep charged.
And dumb in concept: who's wants a 5 hr running conversation when we just need to communicate
when stopped at an intersection about which way to turn? I want a way to use my noise-reducing
earbuds with an off the shelf radio through my phone so that I can also hear music or GPS.
Also, I like to keep my phone in my jacket pocket so there are no dangling wires. But I don't
want to have to look at the radio to use it or worry about charging it before riding.

__Feature Set:__
o Custom FRS, GMRS, or CB integration
    o GMRS appears to offer best cost-vs-performance, with usable range of a couple miles and cross-compatibility with FRS
    o "Custom-built HAM radio?": "http://projects.somerlot.net/._RoboticsProjects016.html#___sec15"
o Integration with phone for multi-audio stream management
o Custom handlebar control to only activate mic during push-to-talk, or switch it to VOX for regular hands-free
o Charging bracket
o Cross-use capable for skiing, hiking, trekking, and emergencies that are out of cell range
o Components that are cheap enough to keep spares of or available enough to find anywhere

__Phasing:__
o Purchase radio unit
o Start with wired connectivity, with phone and radio in tank bag:
    o Build audio plug adapter to splice radio and phone to earbuds
    o Add handlebar switch to mic for PTT
o Add wireless integration
    o Build radio mount with charge bracket
    o Build custom Bluetooth audio adapter to connect radio to phone

__BOM:__
* "GPRS/FRS radio": "https://www.amazon.com/Midland-GXT1000VP4-Channel-Two-Way-Waterproof/dp/B001WMFYH4"
* "BLE widget": "https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995"

======= Track GDD =======
o Use a (google?) calendar of observations to track growing degree days
    o User enters garden events on the google calendar when it happens (ie sunflowers bloom)
      o Next season the garden events are predicted
      o can start off with a database of "known" GDD events (crops, etc)
      o can track other seasonal things like honeybee activity, pest occurance, etc
    o The program uses an online API to pull daily min/max temperatures for user's locale and calculate GDD for each observed event from previous seasons
      o can use long-term temp forecasts to predict occurances of events
      o Updates calendar of predicted events
    o Host on "pythonanywhere": "https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/csomerlot/shares/d795cc4ade44422ea92ab1f1d43fab8e/" as a web service
o References
    o "Calculating GDD": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_degree-day"
o Local temperature
    o Onset datalogger
    o "DarkSky API": "https://rapidapi.com/darkskyapis/api/dark-sky/endpoints"

o Based on computed and measured ballistic performance
  o Empirical test data to refine bullet drag and air density coefficients
o Integrate with GPS, mapping, online weather stations, USB weather station

======= Retail support tools =======
===== Scheduler =====
o Rule-based genetic algorithm optimizer

@@@CODE ./code/Scheduler.py

===== Rewards Program Calculator =====
o Description
    o This application was developed to track customer spending, in order to determine eligibility for rewards certificates. It relies on data exported from the POS system, and does not in any way touch any databases.
o Usage
    o Overview
        o Assuming that you created the spreadsheet correctly, usage is pretty self explanatory. There are only 3 buttons. However,
        if the application crashes, it should prompt you to automatically send an error report via email to the developer (Chris).
    o Input
        o This application reads in an excel spreadsheet that was exported from the EaglePOS system, which must include sales YTD
        for each customer, as well as mailing info. If the application can't find the necessary data, it should let you know.
    o Output
        o This is the secret part, and will be filled in later.
o "Download installer": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/projects.somerlot.net/Programming/setup.exe" (if you have permissions)
