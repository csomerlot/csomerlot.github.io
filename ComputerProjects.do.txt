======= Track GDD =======
o Use a google calendar to track growing degree days
    o User enters garden events on the google calendar when it happens (ie sunflowers bloom)
    o The program connects to NOAA to pull daily min/max temperatures for user's locale and calculate GDD
    o Next season the garden events are predicted
    o can start off with a database of "known" GDD events (crops, etc)
    o can track other seasonal things like honeybee activity, pest occurance, etc
    o Can use local temp recorder rather than NOAA measurements for fine tuning to micro-locale
    o can use long-term projected temperatures to predict occurances of events
    o Updates iCal file of calendar events
o References
    o Calculating GDD
o Local temperature
    o Onset datalogger
    o weatherunderground PWS
======= Tartan designer =======
o A gui-based designer for weaving

======= Somerlot Shooting Support System (S4) =======
o Basic ballistics calc to support F-Class gun (drop and windage)
o Based on computed and measured ballistic performance
o Integrate with GPS, mapping, online weather stations, USB weather station
======= Rewards Program Calculator =======
o Description
    o This application was developed to track customer spending, in order to determine eligibility for rewards certificates. It relies on data exported from the POS system, and does not in any way touch any databases.
o Usage
    o Overview
        o Assuming that you created the spreadsheet correctly, usage is pretty self explanatory. There are only 3 buttons. However, if the application crashes, it should prompt you to automatically send an error report via email to the developer (Chris).
    o Input
        o This application reads in an excel spreadsheet that was exported from the EaglePOS system, which must include sales YTD for each customer, as well as mailing info. If the application can't find the necessary data, it should let you know.
    o Output
        o This is the secret part, and will be filled in later.
