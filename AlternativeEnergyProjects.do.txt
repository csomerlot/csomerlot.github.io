We currently use about 18000 kWh per year (avg 50 kWh per day), with electric heat (25%) and hot water (50%), and 5 face cord of firewood for alternative heat. Better basement sealing could probably reduce this 10%. If we put solar panels on the barn roof, "a 6 kW unit would pay for itself in 5 years": "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189Td1nhGW3Vrj0CtqKAWVy8kJlys1NEx5la_6wacGrw/edit#gid=1167446425".

======= Concrete Silo Retrofits =======
This structure isn't going anywhere, so use it

===== Wind Mill Generator =====
o Use old silo for base structure, but otherwise "follow a historical build": "http://www.yorktown-windmill.org/"
  o o 12ft diameter wind vanes (with auto-furling) should peak out at
  o A modern upgrade: a 20ft diameter thrust bearing for it to change direction automatically
o Mount generator on top: 1kw Unit, for about 10kWh per year
  o House inverter and electroncs inside and send high-voltage back to house?
  o There is 12 mph avg wind speed at our house - maybe a little higher on top of silo?
  o Option 1: connect to grid and net-meter (against zoning, without variance)
  o Option 2: power certain dedicated devices
    o water pre-heater tank
    o small battery bank and certain appliances
    o compressed air
    o water pump
  o "Calcs": "http://zebu.uoregon.edu/1996/ph162/l14.html"

===== Stirling Engine Solar Powerplant =====
o retrofit the old silo for
 o housing for a large Stirling engine
  o engine configuration TBD (ross-yoke beta?) but these are good ideas
   o custom built 20-30 cf steel fabrication
    o old propane tanks?
   o working fluid is air
    o cheaply available
    o charged by air compressor
   o engine drives fly wheel which drives generator head
 o solar collector to heat air for engine
  o create collector from metal roofing
  o use small solar PV powered-pump to ensure engine is self-starting
   o only moves water when sunny, to avoid nightime cooling
 o cooling tower to dissipate heat from engine
  o needs to be insulated from solar collector side?

======= Hydrogen Generator =======
o Electrolysis of water
o Use deeply submerged tanks to collect the gas, to minimize compression

======= Wood gasification using high biomass willows =======
o For powering IC engines
o References

======= Solar water heater =======
o For preheating hot water supply
o Run hot water loop to faucets for instant hot water
o Collector design
    o Insulated box with black metal roofing
    o Copper pipe loop collects heat in insulated box, transmits heat to water in holding tank
    o Brine as transfer liquid, so it won't freeze
o Controller design
    o python-based microcontroller
    o logic: if temp in collector > temp in heat exchanger, then run pump
o Heat Exchanger design
    o Modified propane tank, with insulation
    o Collector fluid runs through replacable copper coil inside tank
    o pressure/heat relief valve

======= Wood Stove =======
o Set furnace fan to run on timer to distribute heat and run air cleaner

======= Tractor GenSet =======
o 24 hp can power a 15kw Genset head
    o Enough to power water heater and well pump at same time
o Buy genset head and mount to tractor, driven by mower belt
