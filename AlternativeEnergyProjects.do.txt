======= Wind Generator =======
o uses old silo
  o mount generator on top
  o house inverter and electroncs inside - send high-voltage back to house
o 1kw Unit
  o 12ft diameter
o There is 12 mph avg wind speed at our house
  o probably a little higher on top of silo
o Connect to grid and net-meter
  o or, only power certain dedicated devices
   o water pre-heater tank?
   o small battery bank and certain appliances
    o water pump
    o furnace

======= Stirling Engine Solar Powerplant =======
o retrofit the old silo for
 o housing for a large Stirling engine
  o engine configuration TBD (ross-yoke beta?) but these are good ideas
   o custom built 20-30 cf steel fabrication
    o old propane tanks?
   o working fluid is air
    o cheaply available
    o charged by air compressor
   o engine drives fly wheel which drives generator head
 o solar collector to heat air for engine
  o create collector from metal roofing
  o use small solar PV powered-pump to ensure engine is self-starting
   o only moves water when sunny, to avoid nightime cooling
 o cooling tower to dissipate heat from engine
  o needs to be insulated from solar collector side?

======= Hydrogen Generator =======
o Electrolysis of water
o Use deeply submerged tanks to collect the gas, to minimize compression

======= Wood gasification using high biomass willows =======
o For powering IC engines
o References
	o UN doc
	o World Bank doc

======= Solar water heater =======
o For preheating hot water supply
o Run hot water loop to faucets for instant hot water
o Collector design
	o Insulated box with black metal roofing
	o Copper pipe loop collects heat in insulated box, transmits heat to water in holding tank
	o Brine as transfer liquid, so it won't freeze
o Controller design
	o python-based microcontroller
	o logic: if temp in collector > temp in heat exchanger, then run pump
o Heat Exchanger design
	o Modified propane tank, with insulation
	o Collector fluid runs through replacable copper coil inside tank
	o pressure/heat relief valve

======= Wood Stove =======
o Set furnace fan to run on timer to distribute heat and run air cleaner

======= Tractor GenSet =======
o 24 hp can power a 15kw Genset head
	o Enough to power water heater and well pump at same time
o Buy genset head and mount to tractor, driven by mower belt

#======= Stirling Engine Refrigeration =======

======= Windmill =======
o Convert old silo
