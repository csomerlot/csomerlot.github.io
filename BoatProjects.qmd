# Boat Projects

##  Building a Whitehall 
These very straight-forward but beatuiful, fast rowing sailboats, seem like an ideal first project. 
Years ago I received [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=6RKdTOWGYjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) 
on building a [whitehall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_rowboat), and it is perhaps the most perfect representation of a boat that I can find.

### ool options to consider:

1. [Removable thwart, like in Chesapeake Light Crafts version](https://www.clcboats.com/modules/catalog/boat.php?category_qn=rowboats&code=chester-yawl-row-boat-kit&print=1)
1. [A tent like Roger Barnes' dinghy tent](https://youtu.be/iDSEbhyIzX0)
1. Dolly with bike wheels for beach launching
  

##  Skin-on-frame kayak or canoe
These seem like the ideal confluence of utility, DIY, beauty, and highly refined design. I have invested in some Cape Falcon plans 
and am on the hunt for good wood.

1. Greenland style
1. wood choices
        1. Black locust: no problem sourcing, but heavy?
        1. Douglas fir: hard to source green
        1. Ash: going, going... gone?

##  Nested Dinghy 
Should a first project be something more cookie cutter? It would certainly simplify (speed up) a build, and 
you can't get anything more simplified than a kit dinghy, like the [PT11](http://www.ptwatercraft.com/ptwatercraft/PT11Home.html)

###  Specs 
* Length: 11' 0"
* Hull Weight: 90 lbs.
* Beam: 50 in.
* Max Payload: 518 lbs.
* Rowing Draft: 4"
* Sailing Draft: 24"
* Sail Area: 54 sq ft.


##  Ultralight Trimaran 
These multihulls have come so far in comfort and performance recently. I am fascinated... and researching. Previous thoughts were for a simple layout with a
stitch-and-glue main hull, and skin on frame amas.

###  Repair Work 

1. Hulls
    1. Powerwash
    1. Spot epoxy repair, fiberglass repair under aft starboard support junction
    1. Redo gelcoat
    1. Stablize / Replace foam? There is a bunch of loose stuff in there
    1. Replace drain plugs, for good measure
1. Trampoline
    1. Clean
    1. Replace 3/8" line in seam?
1. Standing rigging
    1. Need four 316SS clevis pins for forward turnbuckles
    1. Replace all stays with 1/8" UHMWPE (40 ft)
1. Need 1/8 [UHMWPE](https://usarope.net/product/18-spectra-12-strand/), 20 ft, to lash trampoline to rear cross member
    1. Sail dry lube for tracks
1. Running Rigging
    1. Replace halyard (1/8" UHMWPE, 40 ft )
1. [New steering assembly](https://www.storerboatplans.com/boatplans/viola-sailing-canoe-plan-cartop-sailing-dinghy/rigging-details-for-the-viola-14-sailing-canoe/make-simple-canoe-rudder-rudderbox-sailing/)
    1. Avoids expensive pintles, and more secure
    1. Simpler and better steering than kick-up rudders
    1. Tillers: aluminum tube
    1. Rudder
        1. 3mm sheet aluminum for box
        1. Fabricate blade from wood
1. Pittsford Lumber has sheets of [Marine Okaume-Joubert plywood](https://www.pittsfordlumber.com/Pittsford-Lumber/Marine-Okoume-Plywood-Rochester-NY.html) in 6mm
            1. Epoxy and then gelcoat
1. Sail: Tear near foot
1. Misc Hardware
    1. Need 4 clevis pins to attach cross members to hulls: 1/4"-2 1/2" 316SS
    1. Pins for center boards are missing: fabricate from SS bolts with acrylic tubing
1. Mast
  1. Mast step missing: fabricate from 316SS plate and a high-strength pin
  1. Float missing (but forums say do without)
  1. Spray-foam ends to seal

##  Amphibious Vehicle System 
What nerd hasn't tried to figure this one out? I think the reason that we don't have a commercial product like this is that a break-away, auto-positioning, self-launching hull system is very hard.


###  Electric Hatch-back 
With the rise of electric outboards, a drive system is easier than ever when coupled to a high-output alternator. Or at least, would be fun to experiment with!

* Split hull stored on roof on land mode
* Hull gets placed for drive-on at boat launch and has rollers for transition into water
* Dual electric thrust pods are coupled to the wheels somehow for directional control via the steering wheel


###  Amphibious Truck/Camper Van 
* Pontoons swing from overhead down under truck by hydraulics
* Dual hydraulic jet drives in pontoons
* Belt-driven hydraulic pump off motor for hydraulic power


###  Car Barge 
* High-displacement, low draft drive-on LST-style carrier that stays behind when transitioning to land
* Hydraulic drive-on or roll-off deck to completely isolate the vehicle from touching water when transitioning dockside, boat launch, or even from beach
* Deck uses turn table for loading from an angle and for forward on and off. Also, incorporates a lift to raise/lower and keep COG low when onboard
* Electric propulsion driven from on-board batteries, recharged via high-output alternator on the car, shore power and/or solar PV panels
* back of the envelope math: a 20hp [electric outboard](https://www.torqeedo.com/us/en-us/products/outboards/cruise/cruise-10.0-r/M-1240-00.html) draws 10kW peak (15 mph), 1.5 kW at cruise (5 mph), and a [high-output alternator](https://www.nationsstarteralternator.com/270-Amp-XP-High-Output-Alternator-for-Subaru-p/13645-270-xp.htm) on a small hatchback car (4.25 ton) can produce 3.5kW at 2500 rpm.
* Remote or auto-piloting of barge from slip or mooring allows user to remain in vehicle through transition
* Hull can take many forms, including houseboat, canalboat, internal docking barge, large trimaran
* Lift points for loading onto rail flatbed for long-hauling
* Use a pivoting gantry crane instead, like a log trailer?


###  Hydrofoiling Buggy 
With the rise of hub motors, is an axle even required? If no axle, no through-hull? 

* A sand-buggy or humvee style amphibious electric vehicle 
* Aluminium unibody frame sporting 4 hub motors with wheels on parallel linkage, bolted outside of the frame
* Then, hydrofoiled thrusters to go to [water mode](https://candela.com/candela-c-8/)
* Mechanical simplicity to deliver maximum range, stability, traction, with minimal weight, wake, maintenance
