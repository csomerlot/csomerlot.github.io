# Boat Projects

##  Building a Whitehall 
My first project in building a sailboat, for the someday I dream of... years ago I received [this book](https://books.google.com/books?id=6RKdTOWGYjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) on building a [whitehall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_rowboat), and it is perhaps the most perfect representation of a boat that I can find.

Cool options to consider:

1. [Removable thwart, like in Chesapeake Light Crafts version](https://www.clcboats.com/modules/catalog/boat.php?category_qn=rowboats&code=chester-yawl-row-boat-kit&print=1)
1. [A tent like Roger Barnes' dinghy tent](https://youtu.be/iDSEbhyIzX0)
1. Dolly with bike wheels for beach launching
  

##  Skin-on-frame Kayak 

1. greenland style
1. use traditional measurement system
    1. 3 fathom plus 1 cubit is length, etc
1. standard european paddle
1. Materials
    1. canvas as skin (for first one, at least)
    1. wood choices
            1. Black locust
            1. Douglas fir
            1. Ash

##  Nested Dinghy 
Should a first project be something more cookie cutter? It would certainly simplify (speed up) a build, and 
you can't get anything more simplified than a kit dinghy, like the [PT11](http://www.ptwatercraft.com/ptwatercraft/PT11Home.html)

##  Skin on Frame Ultralight Trimaran 
1. Can be built in field with minimum of tools, in emergency
1. Baidrka-style kayaks as pontoons (amas)
    1. Inflatable bouancy bags for rigidity
1. Dual skegs for very shallow draft
1. Minimize gear, ground tackle, and trimming to keep ultralight to maximize speed
1. Simplest field-buildable sail rig with most power:
    1. lateen?

##  Amphibious Vehicle System 
What nerd hasn't tried to figure this one out? I think the reason that we don't have a commercial product like this is that a break-away, auto-positioning, self-launching hull system is very hard.


###  Electric Hatch-back 
With the rise of electric outboards, a drive system is easier than ever when coupled to a high-output alternator. Or at least, would be fun to experiment with!

* Split hull stored on roof on land mode
* Hull gets placed for drive-on at boat launch and has rollers for transition into water
* Dual electric thrust pods are coupled to the wheels somehow for directional control via the steering wheel


###  Amphibious Truck/Camper Van 
* Pontoons swing from overhead down under truck by hydraulics
* Dual hydraulic jet drives in pontoons
* Belt-driven hydraulic pump off motor for hydraulic power


###  Car Barge 
* High-displacement, low draft drive-on LST-style carrier that stays behind when transitioning to land
* Hydraulic drive-on or roll-off deck to completely isolate the vehicle from touching water when transitioning dockside, boat launch, or even from beach
* Deck uses turn table for loading from an angle and for forward on and off. Also, incorporates a lift to raise/lower and keep COG low when onboard
* Electric propulsion driven from on-board batteries, recharged via high-output alternator on the car, shore power and/or solar PV panels
* back of the envelope math: a 20hp [electric outboard](https://www.torqeedo.com/us/en-us/products/outboards/cruise/cruise-10.0-r/M-1240-00.html) draws 10kW peak (15 mph), 1.5 kW at cruise (5 mph), and a [high-output alternator](https://www.nationsstarteralternator.com/270-Amp-XP-High-Output-Alternator-for-Subaru-p/13645-270-xp.htm) on a small hatchback car (4.25 ton) can produce 3.5kW at 2500 rpm.
* Remote or auto-piloting of barge from slip or mooring allows user to remain in vehicle through transition
* Hull can take many forms, including houseboat, canalboat, internal docking barge, large trimaran
* Lift points for loading onto rail flatbed for long-hauling
* Use a pivoting gantry crane instead, like a log trailer?


###  Hydrofoiling Buggy 
With the rise of hub motors, is an axle even required? If no axle, no through-hull? 

* A sand-buggy or humvee style amphibious electric vehicle 
* Aluminium unibody frame sporting 4 hub motors with wheels on parallel linkage, bolted outside of the frame
* Then, hydrofoiled thrusters to go to [water mode](https://candela.com/candela-c-8/)
* Mechanical simplicity to deliver maximum range, stability, traction, with minimal weight, wake, maintenance
