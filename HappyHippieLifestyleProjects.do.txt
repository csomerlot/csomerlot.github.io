======= Backpacking Gear To Make =======
- Chameleon Tent: Hammock - Bivy - all purpose tent
    * "Bridge hammock": "https://www.eurekatentscanada.com/products/view/494?s=section_4" (as opposed to gathered-ends hammock) because:
      * I can't seem how to figure out "how to sleep comfortably": "https://www.treklightgear.com/blogs/trek-life/hammock-angle" in a gathered-ends hammock, and my legs stick out when at an angle
      * I don't want to buy a underquilt (or do I: very light weight and can make myself?)
      * I don't care about weight or needing poles
    * Similar to "Eureka Solitaire": "https://eurekacamping.johnsonoutdoors.com/tents/backpacking/solitaire-al?id=21436", maybe even just figure out how to attach this into a "kit": "https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/diy-hammock-kits/products/pre-cut-bridge-hammock-kit?variant=7685978554416" hammock?
