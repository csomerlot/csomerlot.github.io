======= North Woods Cottage =======
o idea came from discussions during New Year's get togethers (JoAnna calls it a commune)
o we want a place of our own that is in a remote location (no motor access), on the water, that will give us access to the (state) woods for
    o New Year's hangout
    o skiiing
    o canoeing
    o biking
    o hiking
o Brantingham area seems good location for proximity, snowfall, biking and skiing on tug hill plateau, hiking in Thendara, and general proximity to Canoe Wilderness. Or Cape Breton.
o Easy (cheap) to own
o ideally, is teardown/rebuild of existing structure
o keep a low investment and carry no insurance or utility costs
o keep the tax assessor away with blair-witch stick-piles, boooby traps, scary dogs, yellin', and gun fire (in that order)
o Architecural style should maximize use of simple, renewable, recyclable, biodegradable materials
o "Great example design": "https://youtu.be/MsDTfWLLv3Y"

===== HayBaleHome =====
o slab foundation
    o concrete floor colored and grooved to look like tiles
    o gravel substrate, but need foam for insulation?
o straw bale walls (excellent thermal qualities)
o thatched roof (excellent thermal qualities)
o rubble trench foundation footer (will need to go down to 5')
o simple floorplan for easy construction
o 1.5 bathrooms
o loft for sleeping space
o beds for 8
o single-pane windows with inner and outer shutters for security, cost, strength, and warmth
o screen doors downstairs and in loft for ventilation
o suspend gear (canoes, bikes, etc) from rafters
o Mechanicals should be off-grid, minimalistic (see below)
    o heat
        o masonry wood stove
    o light
        o battery and/or oil, candles
    o water
        o overhead tank for pressure
            o 30" pipe in roof apex will hold 1000 gallons (but weigh 4 tons)
        o low-power electric pump operated by solar panel
        o hand pump in kitchen sink (also backs up electric pump)
        o hand-augered well
        o low-flow shower head
    o waste
        o composting toilets
        o kitchen and shower grey-water system
    o hot water
        o "propane on-demand": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002JLSH5S/?coliid=I3NOBK27OJ5OOF&colid=LXYPR4UA5ISY&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it"
        o a 20lb tank will give 8hrs of shower hot water (overhead tank is already room temp!)
    o electricity
        o use a deep cycle battery and inverter, charged from solar cell
        o really should just be used for lights, charging devices, using speakers, etc.
o kitchen
    o small propane fridge and cooking stove
    o grilling in summer
    o wood stove in winter
o wine cave built into the side of a hill somewhere nearby (they can burn the house but they cain't have the booze! Keep guns and a chainsaw and some cans of food in there too)
o Construction phasing
    o find and acquire property and site building
    o construct yurt, hand pumped well, and outhouse for temporary housing
    o build foundation and slab
    o build walls, roof ridgepole with temp roofing
    o put mechanicals in place
    o roof
    o furnish
o materials estimates (we have to carry everything in by canoe!)
    - concrete: 10 yds (~400 80lb bags)
    - rebar: 2 ton
    - straw: ?
    - stone: ?
    - gravel: ?

===== A-Frame Tiny House =====
Same basic ideas and mechanicals as the HayBaleHome, but:
* Smaller; sleeps only 4 but far easier to site
* Simpler construction:
    * Minimal footprint: No foundation, just 4 or 5 concrete tube pilings
    * "SIP": "https://www.sips.org/about/what-are-sips"
        * "high insulation": "http://www.coloradoenergy.org/procorner/stuff/r-values.htm"
        * modular construction
        * no beams

===== Off-grid Mechanicals Vault =====
Every camp-type structure would benefit from a temporary and small electricity supply and running hot water. A 
minimalistic vault design can help simplify the setup, maintenance, and constructability of this. Obviously, 
every design parameter depends on conservation and reduction of need. A dry temp-stable space is also a great spot 
for emergency supplies.

o Structure:
    o Constructability: 4 ft cube built of double-layer waterproof plywood, with spray foam in between
    o 95% buried for thermal efficiency, low noise, and security
    o Accessible and visible top (so no one runs it over) yet protected from the elements and vandalism. Could also site structure on top of it, and size it for lock-box usage as well.
    o insulated and heated for consistent temp and low humidity
o Mechanicals
    o Battery bank: lithium
    o Well: some people "do this": "https://www.drillyourownwell.com/" but a lot depends on siting for soil type and depth to water table
    o Pump: 12v, need not be large capacity
    o Pressure Tank
        o this shouldn't be large, as a portable water tower should be used for increased capacity
    o Filter: 50 micron fiber followed by 5 micron charcoal to remove sediment, chemicals, and protozoa
    o UV: to remove bacteria and viruses
    o Propane tankless water heater:
        o if its a long pipe run, may want to move inside
        o solar preheat coils?
    o Power:
        o 12v for safety and convenience
        o charger that can handle solar, genset, alternator, or wind turbine inputs
o Monitoring:
    o power level and charge rates
    o filter pressure drop
    o UV beam strength
    o vault temp and humidity
    o telemetery: wifi? feather LoRa?
    o pressure tank back pressure
    o vault door alarm
    o propane and CO monitors
    o well and dry-well levels and temp
    o pump draw, flow rate, and pressure
    o propane tank pressure
