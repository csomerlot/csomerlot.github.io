======= Building a Whitehall =======
My first project in building a sailboat, for the someday I dream of... years ago I received "this book": "https://books.google.com/books?id=6RKdTOWGYjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false" on building a "whitehall": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_rowboat", and it is perhaps the most perfect representation of a boat that I can find.

======= Cruising Catamaran for Lake Ontario =======
o a trailerable 25'-ish open deck multihull
o ample sail plan for light wind
    o Sloop rigged
    o Spinnaker
        o no pole needed
    o pirate-red sails
o 10hp OB in center wet well for propulsion
o each hull self-serving for 1 couple with double berth
    o hinged breeze-way hatches
    o WC
        o with composting toilets
        o foot-pump operated sinks
    o water tank
    o fuel tank
o stow-away galley and nav/lounge table on deck
o deep-V hulls so no daggerboards
o kick-up rudders
o plywood stitch and glue home construction
o can carry 3 or 4 kayaks up on trampoline
o we'll call her the Glorious Anne-Marie (because there are 2 hulls! get it?)
o she'll probably do 20 knots downwind...

======= Skin-on-frame Kayak =======
o greenland style
o use traditional measurement system
    o 3 fathom plus 1 cubit is length, etc
o standard european paddle
o Materials
    o canvas as skin (for first one, at least)
    o wood choices
            o Black locust
            o Douglas fir
            o Ash

======= Ultralight Trimaran Plans =======
o Can be built in field with minimum of tools, in emergency
    o Skin on Frame?
o Uses kayaks as pontoons (amas)
    o Uses inflatable bouancy bags
    o Won't plane, though
o Dual skegs
o Very shallow draft
o Minimize gear, ground tackle, and trimming to keep ultralight to maximize speed
o Sloop Rigged with Spinnaker
o 20-30 feet
o submersible mode
    o Detach kayaks, demast, flip the boat over and load the trampolines with rocks to create a diving bell using the hull
    o For hiding the boat while you are out kayaking or shelter from bad storms
    o pedal-powered bilge pump doubles as air snorkel

======= Catamaran Daysailor =======
Jon and I inherited one from his childhood.
===== Cal Cat =====
o Specs:
  o LOA:
  o LWL:
  o Beam:
  o Sail area:
o Similar designs (for parts):
  o Hobie Inspiration
  o "Aqua Cat 14": "https://www.americansail.com/products/boats/aqua-cat-14-catamaran"
  o "Paper tiger": "http://www.papertigercatamaran.org/"
===== Repair Work =====
o Hulls
    o Powerwash
    o Spot epoxy repair, fiberglass repair under aft starboard support junction
    o Redo gelcoat
    o Stablize / Replace foam? There is a bunch of loose stuff in there
    o Replace drain plugs, for good measure
o Trampoline
    o Clean
    o Replace 3/8" line in seam?
o Standing rigging
    o Need four 316SS clevis pins for forward turnbuckles
    o Need 1/8" "UHMWPE": "https://usarope.net/product/18-spectra-12-strand/", 20 ft, to lash trampoline to rear cross member
    o Replace all stays with 1/8" UHMWPE
    o Sail dry lube for tracks
o Running Rigging
    o Replace halyard (1/8" UHMWPE, 40 ft )
o "New steering assembly": "https://www.storerboatplans.com/boatplans/viola-sailing-canoe-plan-cartop-sailing-dinghy/rigging-details-for-the-viola-14-sailing-canoe/make-simple-canoe-rudder-rudderbox-sailing/"
    o Avoids expensive pintles, and more secure
    o Simpler and better steering than kick-up rudders
    o Tillers: aluminum tube
    o Rudder
        o 2.5 mm sheet aluminum for box
        o Fabricate blade from wood
            o Pittsford Lumber has sheets of Marine Okaume-Joubert plywood in 1/8"
            o Epoxy and then gelcoat
o Sail: Tear near foot
o Misc Hardware
    o Need 4 clevis pins to attach cross members to hulls: 1/4"-2 1/2" 316SS
    o Pins for center boards are missing: fabricate from SS bolts with acrylic tubing
    o Mast
  o Mast step missing: fabricate from 316SS plate and a high-strength pin
  o Float missing (but forums say do without)

======= Amphibious Vehicle System =======
What nerd hasn't tried to figure this one out? I think the reason that we don't have a commercial product like this is that a break-away, auto-positioning, self-launching hull system is very hard.

===== Electric Hatch-back =====
With the rise of electric outboards, a drive system is easier than ever when coupled to a high-output alternator. Or at least, would be fun to experiment with!
* Split hull stored on roof on land mode
* Hull gets placed for drive-on at boat launch and has rollers for transition into water
* Dual electric thrust pods are coupled to the wheels somehow for directional control via the steering wheel

===== Amphibious Truck/Camper Van =====
* Pontoons swing from overhead down under truck by hydraulics
* Dual hydraulic jet drives in pontoons
* Belt-driven hydraulic pump off motor for hydraulic power

===== Car Barge =====
* High-displacement, low draft drive-on LST-style carrier that stays behind when transitioning to land
* Hydraulic drive-on or roll-off deck to completely isolate the vehicle from touching water when transitioning dockside, boat launch, or even from beach
* Deck uses turn table for loading from an angle and for forward on and off. Also, incorporates a lift to raise/lower and keep COG low when onboard
* Electric propulsion driven from on-board batteries, recharged via high-output alternator on the car, shore power and/or solar PV panels
  * back of the envelope math: a 20hp "electric outboard": "https://www.torqeedo.com/us/en-us/products/outboards/cruise/cruise-10.0-r/M-1240-00.html" draws 10kW peak (15 mph), 1.5 kW at cruise (5 mph), and a "high-output alternator": "https://www.nationsstarteralternator.com/270-Amp-XP-High-Output-Alternator-for-Subaru-p/13645-270-xp.htm" on a small hatchback car (4.25 ton) can produce 3.5kW at 2500 rpm.
* Remote or auto-piloting of barge from slip or mooring allows user to remain in vehicle through transition
* Hull can take many forms, including houseboat, canalboat, internal docking barge, large trimaran
* Lift points for loading onto rail flatbed for long-hauling
* Use a pivoting gantry crane instead, like a log trailer?
