======= Building a Whitehall =======
My first project in building a sailboat, for the someday I dream of... years ago I received "this book": "https://books.google.com/books?id=6RKdTOWGYjoC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false" on building a "whitehall": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall_rowboat", and it is perhaps the most perfect representation of a boat that I can find.

======= Cruising Catamaran for Lake Ontario =======
o a trailerable 25'-ish open deck multihull
o ample sail plan for light wind
    o Sloop rigged
    o Spinnaker
        o no pole needed
    o pirate-red sails
o 10hp OB in center wet well for propulsion
o each hull self-serving for 1 couple with double berth
    o hinged breeze-way hatches
    o WC
        o with composting toilets
        o foot-pump operated sinks
    o water tank
    o fuel tank
o stow-away galley and nav/lounge table on deck
o deep-V hulls so no daggerboards
o kick-up rudders
o plywood stitch and glue home construction
o can carry 3 or 4 kayaks up on trampoline
o we'll call her the Glorious Anne-Marie (because there are 2 hulls! get it?)
o she'll probably do 20 knots downwind...
o Study Plans:

======= Skin-on-frame Kayak =======
o greenland style
o use traditional measurement system
    o 3 fathom plus 1 cubit is length, etc
o standard european paddle
o Materials
    o canvas as skin (for first one, at least)
    o wood choices
            o Black locust
            o Douglas fir
            o Ash

======= Ultralight Trimaran Plans =======
o Can be built in field with minimum of tools, in emergency
    o Skin on Frame?
o Uses kayaks as pontoons (amas)
    o Uses inflatable bouancy bags
    o Won't plane, though
o Dual skegs
o Very shallow draft
o Minimize gear, ground tackle, and trimming to keep ultralight to maximize speed
o Sloop Rigged with Spinnaker
o 20-30 feet
o submersible mode
    o Detach kayaks, demast, flip the boat over and load the trampolines with rocks to create a diving bell using the hull
    o For hiding the boat while you are out kayaking or shelter from bad storms
    o pedal-powered bilge pump doubles as air snorkel

======= Catamaran Daysailor =======
o Attempts at Identification
    o Cal Cat
    o Parts
    o Hobie Inspiration
    o Similar enough to an "Aqua Cat 14": "https://www.americansail.com/products/boats/aqua-cat-14-catamaran" that we can use those parts?
o Repair Work
    o New Rudder assembly
        o Pintles
        o Kick-up rudder heads
        o Rudder blades (1/4" sheet aluminum?)
        o Tillers (aluminum tubes?) missing one length
        o Fabricate from wood?
            o Pittsford Lumber has sheets of Marine Okaume-Joubert plywood in 1/8"
        o FIGURE: [Boats/transom, width=400 frac=0.9] Transom. label{fig:calcat4}
    o Hulls
        o Powerwash
        o Patch gel coat?
        o Stablize / Replace foam? There is a bunch of loose stuff in there
        o Replace drain plugs, for good measure
    o Trampoline
        o Clean
        o Replace 3/8" line in seam?
        o Add grommets on back edge
    o Standing rigging
        o Need four tool-less clevis pins for forward turnbuckles
        o Need 3/16" static line to lash trampoline to rear cross member (approx twenty ft )
        o One aft stay (SS) has 4 busted threads
    o Running Rigging
        o Replace halyard (5/16" static line, forty ft )
    o Mast
        o Mast float missing
        o Mast step missing (fabricate?)
    o Sail
        o Tear near foot
    o Misc Hardware
        o Need 4 bolts to attach cross members to hulls (1/4"-2 1/2" SS, with wing nuts) or quick pins
        o Pins for center boards  are missing - fabricate from SS bolts with acrylic tubing

======= Amphibious Vehicle System =======
What nerd hasn't tried to figure this one out? I think the reason that we don't have a commercial product like this is that a break-away, auto-positioning, self-launching hull system is very hard.

===== Electric Hatch-back =====
With the rise of electric outboards, a drive system is easier than ever when coupled to a high-output alternator. Or at least, would be fun to experiment with!
* Split hull stored on roof on land mode
* Hull gets placed for drive-on at boat launch and has rollers for transition into water
* Dual electric thrust pods are coupled to the wheels somehow for directional control via the steering wheel

===== Amphibious Truck/Camper Van =====
* Pontoons swing from overhead down under truck by hydraulics
* Dual hydraulic jet drives in pontoons
* Belt-driven hydraulic pump off motor for hydraulic power

===== Car Barge =====
* High-displacement, low draft drive-on LST-style carrier that stays behind when transitioning to land
* Hydraulic drive-on or roll-off deck to completely isolate the vehicle from touching water when transitioning dockside, boat launch, or even from beach
* Deck uses turn table for loading from an angle and for forward on and off. Also, incorporates a lift to raise/lower and keep COG low when onboard
* Electric propulsion driven from on-board batteries, recharged via high-output alternator on the car, shore power and/or solar PV panels
  * back of the envelope math: a 20hp "electric outboard": "https://www.torqeedo.com/us/en-us/products/outboards/cruise/cruise-10.0-r/M-1240-00.html" draws 10kW peak (15 mph), 1.5 kW at cruise (5 mph), and a "high-output alternator": "https://www.nationsstarteralternator.com/270-Amp-XP-High-Output-Alternator-for-Subaru-p/13645-270-xp.htm" on a small hatchback car (4.25 ton) can produce 3.5kW at 2500 rpm.
* Remote or auto-piloting of barge from slip or mooring allows user to remain in vehicle through transition
* Hull can take many forms, including houseboat, canalboat, internal docking barge, large trimaran
* Lift points for loading onto rail flatbed for long-hauling
* Use a pivoting gantry crane instead, like a log trailer?
