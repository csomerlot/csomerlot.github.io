##  Backpacking Gear To Make 
* Chameleon Tent: Hammock - Bivy - all purpose tent
  * [Bridge hammock](https://www.eurekatentscanada.com/products/view/494?s=section_4) (as opposed to gathered-ends hammock) because:
    * I can't seem how to figure out [how to sleep comfortably on the diagonal](https://www.treklightgear.com/blogs/trek-life/hammock-angle) in a gathered-ends hammock, and my legs stick out when at an angle
    * I don't want to buy a underquilt (double-layer bottom makes a sleeve for an air pad!)
    * I don't care about weight or needing poles or the increased hanging distance
  * Similar to [Eureka Solitaire](https://eurekacamping.johnsonoutdoors.com/tents/backpacking/solitaire-al?id=21436), with hoop ends and able to pitch on the ground
  * Start with a [kit](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/diy-hammock-kits/products/pre-cut-bridge-hammock-kit?variant=7685978554416) hammock, add no-seeum netting
  * Rain flap [like this](https://wingmanoftheroad.com/products/goose-1)
  * Lots of [these](https://www.amazon.com/ETROL-Mosquito-Lightweight-Portable-Hammocks/dp/B07M5SPH2Z/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=bridge%2Bhammock&qid=1650855264&sr=8-8&th=1) on Amazon these days but they all look cheap and short
  * [Daisy chain](https://hammockgear.com/ultralight-daisy-chain-per-foot/) for easy hanging
  * In the end I bought a [wind anchor tent](https://thecatal.net/)
* Fold-up wood burning grill with blower
  * Like [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012NHG1CS/?coliid=I32YFIHZ75Y1T&colid=LXYPR4UA5ISY&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) but with the option of attaching a blower
